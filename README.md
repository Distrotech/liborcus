Orcus - library for processing spreadsheet documents.

Orcus is a library that provides a collection of standalone file processing
filters.  It is currently focused on providing filters for spreadsheet
documents, but filters for other productivity application types (such as
wordprocessor and presentation) are in consideration.

The library currently includes filters for xlsx, ods, csv, and generic XML
formats.
